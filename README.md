# Engineering Design by Artificial Intelligence

Are you interested in new ways of engineering design? This repository is an attempt to apply artificial intelligence algorithms for the purpose of engineering design of electrical and structural elements and components. I combine numerical simulation like finite element analysis with artificial intelligence like reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to produce optimal designs. In fact, I started fusing RL and FEA for the purpose of structural engineering design since 2018. Recently, my work has been focused on the analysis of dynamics of offshore structures, electrical circuits and topology optimization. I am constantly exploring different ways that AI can be applied to science and engineering. With my diverse interests, I am using this repository as a testbed for my ideas to create industry standard software for artificial intelligence aided design. I hope that my work can inspire you to explore new ways that AI can be applied to your field.

At present, Gigala software consists of two moduli: topology optimization and offshore dynamics. It uses artificial intelligence to assist an engineer in her design. You can use it as research or engineering analysis tool to design different mechanical and electrical components and elements, or to understand marine dynamics.
