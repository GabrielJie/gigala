# Engineering Design by AI
This repository is an attempt to apply artificial intelligence algorithms for the purpose of engineering design of structural elements e.g. aircraft components. More specifically I combine finite element analysis and reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms to produce optimal (in terms of strength and weight) structures.  

Please see  [manuals](https://github.com/gigatskhondia/Engineering_Design_by_Artificial_Intelligence/tree/master/design_by_reinforcement_learning_and_finite_element_analysis/manuals) for the specifics of the models and algorithms I use.
