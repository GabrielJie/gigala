# Engineering Design by AI
This repository is an attempt to apply artificial intelligence algorithms for the purpose of engineering design of structural elements like aircraft components. More specifically I combine finite element analysis and reinforcement learning to produce optimal (in terms of strength and weight) structures.  

Please see  [manuals](https://github.com/gigatskhondia/Engineering_Design_by_Artificial_Intelligence/tree/master/manuals) for the specifics of the models and algorithms I use.

To keep up to date with the project please check [Gigala](https://www.facebook.com/GigaTsk) page.


*Currently investigating whether any ideas from neural architecture search could be applied to mechanical parts domain design.*
