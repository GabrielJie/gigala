# Engineering Design by AI
This repository is an attempt to apply artificial intelligence algorithms for the purpose of engineering design ( of structural elements like aircraft components, marine structures and operations, etc.). More specifically I combine numerical simulation  (e.g. finite element analysis) with artificial intelligence methods (e.g reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms) to produce optimal strucutral design.  

Please see  [manuals](https://github.com/gigatskhondia/gigala/tree/master/examples/design_by_reinforcement_learning_and_finite_element_analysis/manuals) for the specifics of the models and algorithms I use.
