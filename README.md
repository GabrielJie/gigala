# Engineering Design by Artificial Intelligence

Are you interested in the new ways of engineering design? This repository is an attempt to apply artificial intelligence algorithms for the purpose of engineering design of electrical and structural elements and components. I combine numerical simulation like finite element analysis with artificial intelligence like reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to produce optimal designs. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, I was the first who started using combination of RL and FEA for the purpose of structural engineering design in 2018. Recently, my work has been focused on the analysis of dynamics of offshore structures, electrical circuits and topology optimization. I am constantly exploring different ways that AI can be applied to science and engineering. With my diverse interests, I am using this repository as a testbed for my ideas. I hope that my work can inspire you to explore the different ways that artificial intelligence can be applied to your field.

On how to apply recent developments in Generative AI to my solution: you can feed an image to chatGPT and ask it questions about this image. For example, you can ask 'do you like this image?'. In case of designing a structure like a bridge, you can ask 'do you like this design of a bridge?'. Based on chatGPT's answer you can calculate a sentiment score. You can feed this sentiment score to your RL agent as additional reward (making it huge). You do not have to ask chatGPT every MDP iteration step, just once in a while.
